What are data structures, and why are they important?***\n","\n","*ans: In python language the data structures are used to organize & storing data so that it can be accessed and manipulate efficiently basically it is used to access, manipulate and store the data by specific structure for special task performing; The data structure is important for the organizing data in python for many use-cases the data structures in python like string,list,tuple,set,dictionary for each specific task each data structure get used*\n","\n","***2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?***\n","\n","*ans:1) The term mutable stands and means that the items of the data structure can be changed and manipulate; like we can directly change the items by the index[] method accessing  \n","Ex: list[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] so here, we want to change the element like here 7 by 8; we can change so for that we use operation like, list[6]=8\n","so, by this operation the item can be changed and displayed list[1,2,3,4,5,6,8] so the list is Mutable.*\n","\n","*2) The term immutable stands and means that the items of the data structure cannot be changed and manipulate; like we can't directly change the items by the index[] method accessing*\n","\n","*Ex: tuple[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] so here, we want to change the element like here 7 by 8; we wil change so for that we use operation like, tuple[6]=8\n","so, by this operation the item cannot be changed and displayed the Error :\"tuple cannot perform item assignment\" Tuple is Immutable.*\n","\n","***3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?***\n","\n","*ans: i)list is a \"mutable\" data structure in other hands tuple is \"immutable\" it means that you can change the elements of data structure so indexing is valid in list i.e mutable and you cannot change the elements i.e immutable so indexing is not valid in tuple  \n","ii)list denoted by \"[]\" and tuple denoted by \"()\" in both you can add any type of values because both are 'heterogenous'\n","iii) tuples are generally faster than list because we can change the list so more memory is used but not tuple case.\n","iv) tuples dont have functions but list have methods built-in functions() for changing the list\n","v) size of tuple is small than size of list.*\n","\n","***4.Describe how dictionaries store data?***\n","\n","*ans: dictionary is the data structure in python used for storing and organizing and managing data and used for key-value pairs based data structure\n","the dictionaries store the data in {Key:Value} pair format like {\"emp-Id\":\"E012\"}, this is the main use of this data structure like the \"employee-Id\" is the \"key\" and \"value\" is \"Id\": \"E012\". so it shows the important relation and connection of data structure for storage method of dictionary\n","Syntax: {'this side you name the key ' : 'this side you give the value '} ; the \":\" represents key value and \"{}\" is used for dictionary\n","the dictionary is also \"heterogenous\" in nature and it is \"immutable\" by \"indexing method\" but \"mutable\" by the \"key-name access method\" like\n","dict1={'name':'pqr','roll-no':'123'} so for \"mutability\" you can access it by the key i.e is dict1('name')(mutable) and also you can change the value like dict1('name')='ABC' ('mutable ')but cannot change the key of dictionay like dict1('ABC')/ dict1('ABC')='name1' (inavalid) and indexing is totally not allowed its error it doesn't have index no (0,1,2,3) it haves (key1,key2) for access so dict1[0]/ dict[2]='age' is invalid*\n","\n","***5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?***\n","\n","*ans: The set is the python data structure that have unique items in it; and denoted by \"{}\" so sometimes the list have multiple items i.e kind of duplicate items but set have unique elements i.e the unique element is once in output and they are unordered and list is ordered like the set;\n","s={1,2,3,2,4,5,2,2} if you run this then it prints {1,3,2,5,4} i.e double values are considered once in set and those are unordered so if you dont work on ordering/sequence elements and but facing major double data so you can use set instead of the list.*\n","\n","***6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?***\n","\n","*ans: A string is the collection of characters i.e alphabates or etc; A string used under single/double/triple quotes(' '),(\" \"),(\"\"\"  \"\"\").The string is the python data type and data structure for alphabatical used mainly; and \"String is a Immutable data structure\" we cannot do item assignment in string by indexing but we can access string by the index no in python  likely: s='prasad'(created list), s[1] results 'r' and it run successfully but if we do s[2]='k' then it results Error i.e 'str' object does not support item assignment in python, so it simply states that the string can be access by the indexing but cannot do changes in string by item assignment i.e string is 'IMMUTABLE' in other hands 'List' is a python data structure where you can store element with no restricted data type i.e list is heterogenous; you can store any data type value in it and denoted by the '[]' likely; lis=[1,2,3,4,5,6,5] (list created); we can access a list and also update and change the list by the indexing i.e list is the 'mutable' so we can access and modify list like lis[0] it results '1' and lis[6]=7 it results the updated list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] i.e it chnages the value of provided index number so the list can be kind of any data type sequential/ordered and can be changable i.e \" MUTABLE\", So major difference of string and list it is 'sequential/ordered','any data type value','doubled values allowed','modification allowed' the all properties mentioned are in list not in string and main difference is list is 'mutable' and string is 'immutable'*\n","\n","***7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?***\n","\n","*ans: The tuple is python data structure denoted by '()' it allows multiple data typed value in it ; stores the values and also access by the indexing method but cannot assign the element i.e modify and change tuple is not allowed i.e tuple is \"immutable\" so it ensure the data intigrity and Tuples in Python ensure data integrity primarily through their immutability. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed. This characteristic is crucial for maintaining the consistency and reliability of data throughout a program.Usecase can be a employee id,aadhar card no etc*\n","\n","***8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?***\n","\n","*ans: A hash table (or hash map) is a data structure storing key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index (hash code) for each key, known as hashing determining where its value is stored in an underlying array. This allows for very fast (average O(1)) data retrieval, insertion, and deletion.\n","Python's built-in dict type is implemented as a hash table. When you use a Python dictionary, Python handles the hashing of keys, manages the internal array, and resolves collisions. This underlying hash table implementation is why Python dictionaries offer such efficient performance for key-value operations. Keys in Python dictionaries must be \"hashable\" (immutable and have a consistent hash value)*\n","\n","***9.Can lists contain different data types in Python?***\n","\n","*ans: Absolutely yes, because python data structure list allows and work efficiently on the all data types and they stored in list like string int float complexe numbers or boolean values all are access and can store by the list in python that enhances the use of data structure in python and used for many cases where we need a sequential/oredered multi-typed and mutable list for program task.\n","Ex: lis1=['pms',1,2.2,3+4j,True,1,False] (list created) here we used all data typed values as list elements and we can also access them by indexing.*\n","\n","***10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?***\n","\n","*ans: Strings in Python are immutable: their content cannot be changed after creation.\n","This immutability have advantages:1]Hashability: Ensures consistent hash values, vital for dictionary keys and set elements.\n","2]Thread Safety: Prevents concurrent modification issues in multi-threaded environments.\n","3]Predictability: Simplifies code logic as string values are guaranteed not to change.\n","4]Memory Efficiency: Allows Python to optimize memory usage through string interning.\n","5]Security: Guards against unintended data alteration.*\n","\n","***11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?***\n","\n","*ans: In Python, dictionaries are like labeled boxes where you put things, and lists are like numbered rows of things.\n","Dictionaries are better when we need to:Find things by a specific name/label (key): Super fast lookup, like looking up a word in a dictionary.\n","Store related information together: Each \"box\" can hold a complete item with its characteristics (e.g., a person's \"name,\" \"age,\" \"city\").\n","Don't care about the order of items.Lists are better when we need to:Keep items in a specific order: Like a shopping list, where the order matters.\n","Access items by their position: indexing [] ,\"Give me the first item,\" \"the second item,\" etc.*\n","\n","***12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?***\n","\n","*ans: Tuple is python data structure denoted by '()' it is 'immutable' entity where as list is also python data structure denoted by '[]' it is  'mutable' entity, so it mainly differ by the mutable and immutable term so scenario changes here i.e mutable case and immutable case likely;\n","Tuple: If your working on the credential type of task and sensitive term like as employee id credit details aadhar no etc so tuple is good choice to use because tuple is immutable so that ensures data safety security and integrity by immutability i.e does not change after creation, so tuple is useful here; List: If we want sequential and ordered and multiple elements so playlist,To-do list,Shopping List like \"Milk, eggs, bread, cheese, apples.\"etc.We want these items in a specific order, or at least you want all of them or remove any element.We use list for mutability of list.*\n","\n","***13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ?***\n","\n","*ans: Set is a pythonn data structure denoted by \"{}\" and it is unique element storing and it is unordered but mutable by operation functions but immutable by the indexing[] because it is unordered like s1[2] results Error set is unordered.Python sets are designed to store only unique elements. When you try to add a duplicate value to a set, it simply ignores the new addition. The set's content remains unchanged, effectively preventing any duplicate entries. This behavior is fundamental to a set's definition and its core purpose. Ex: s1={1,2,3,4,5,2,4,5} when we run it display unoredered and unique values only consider simply ignores same values or multiple occurance values and displayed unique value like s1(shift+enter) results the {1,3,2,4,5}.*\n","\n","***14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?***\n","\n","*ans: The in keyword in Python checks for membership, but how it works and its efficiency differs significantly between lists and dictionaries due to their underlying structures; For Lists;What it checks: item in my_list checks if item is present as one of the elements in the list.\n","How it works: Python performs a linear search through the list. It starts from the first element and compares each one until it finds a match or reaches the end of the list. For Dictionaries:What it checks: key in my_dictionary checks if key is present as one of the keys in the dictionary. It does not check for values.How it works: Dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you use in, Python calculates the hash of the key and directly goes to the corresponding \"bucket\" in its internal structure. This allows for very quick access.\n","'in' for lists checks for elements via a slow, sequential scan.\n","'in' for dictionaries checks for keys via a fast, direct lookup.*\n","\n","***15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?***\n","\n","*ans: No, tuple is immutable data structure so a tuple in Python is like a fixed, unchangeable list. So No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple after it's created.This is because tuples are immutable. Once you define a tuple, the items inside it are set in stone. You can't add new elements, remove existing ones, or change the value of any element.Think of it like a sealed box of items – you can look inside and use what's there, but you can't swap anything out or put new things in. This \"unchangeable\" nature is a core characteristic of tuples in Python. If you need to change items, you should use a list instead.This is because tuples are immutable. Once you create a tuple, its contents are fixed and cannot be changed, added, or removed. If you try to change an element, Python will give you a TypeError.Think of a tuple like a sealed container. Whatever you put inside when you first seal it stays exactly the same. You can look at what's inside, but you can't swap anything out or add new things. This property makes tuples reliable for data that should not change, like coordinates or database records.*\n","\n","***16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?***\n","\n","*ans: Dictionary in dictionary is nested dictionary.A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values themselves are other dictionaries. It's like having a dictionary inside another dictionary.This structure allows you to organize data hierarchically, creating layers of key-value pairs.\n","Example Use Case: Storing Student Data; in google colab or jupyter notebook we write code :\n","student_data = {\n","    \"student_101\": {\n","        \"name\": \"Alice\",\n","        \"age\": 18,\n","        \"grades\": {\"math\": \"A\", \"science\": \"B\"}\n","    },\n","    \"student_102\": {\n","        \"name\": \"Bob\",\n","        \"age\": 19,\n","        \"grades\": {\"math\": \"B\", \"science\": \"A\"}\n","    }\n","}\n","Here, student_data is the main dictionary. Its values (e.g., student_101) are themselves dictionaries holding details like name, age, and even another nested dictionary for grades. This clearly represents complex, related information.So we can access the student_101 & 102 nested in student_data.*\n","\n","***17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?***\n","\n","*ans: In Python, accessing elements in a dictionary is incredibly fast, usually taking the same amount of time regardless of how many items are in the dictionary. This is known as O(1) time complexity on average, or \"constant time.\" Here's why:Hash Table Power: Python dictionaries are built using a specialized data structure called a hash table.Direct Access: When you ask for a value using its key, Python's internal hash function quickly calculates a specific location (or \"bucket\") where that value should be.No Searching: Instead of searching through every item like a list does, the dictionary can go directly to the calculated spot.Rare Worst Case: In very rare situations, if many different keys happen to produce the same hash code (a \"collision\"), the dictionary might have to do a small extra search, potentially leading to a slower O(n) worst-case. However, Python's hash functions are designed to make these collisions infrequent.\n","So, in most practical scenarios, you can rely on dictionary lookups being extremely efficient and quick.*\n","\n","***18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?***\n","\n","*ans: Lists are preferred over dictionaries in Python when;Order Matters: You need to maintain a specific sequence of items (e.g., a playlist, steps in a recipe).Positional Access: You want to access items by their numerical position (index) rather than a descriptive key (e.g., the first item, the fifth item).Collection of Unrelated Items: You have a simple collection of values where each doesn't need a unique identifier.\n","Duplicates are Allowed/Expected: Lists naturally accommodate duplicate entries, whereas dictionaries only store unique keys.\n","Iterating Sequentially: When you primarily need to loop through all items in a specific order from start to finish.\n","Memory Efficiency for Simple Sequences: For very simple, homogeneous sequences, lists can sometimes be marginally more memory efficient than dictionaries due to less overhead for keys.No Meaningful Keys: If your data doesn't naturally lend itself to unique, descriptive keys.*\n","\n","***19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?***\n","\n","*ans: Historically, Python dictionaries were considered unordered. This meant that the order in which you inserted items might not be the order in which they were retrieved or iterated. Their internal structure (hash tables) prioritized fast lookups over maintaining order.\n","However, since Python 3.7, the built-in dict type guarantees insertion order. This means that when you iterate over a dictionary, the items will be returned in the order they were added. This was initially an implementation detail in Python 3.6 but became an official language feature.\n","So, while older resources might still state dictionaries are unordered, in modern Python (3.7+), they are ordered by insertion. This change means that the order of items does affect iteration, as you can now rely on a consistent sequence when looping through keys, values, or items. However, you still cannot access elements by numerical index like a list. Retrieval is always by key.*\n","\n","***20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.?***\n","\n","*ans: A list retrieves data based on its position or index. You ask for the \"first item\" (index 0), the \"second item\" (index 1), and so on. This is like finding a book on a shelf by its place in the row.\n","A dictionary retrieves data based on a unique key (label). You ask for the value associated with a specific key, like \"name\" or \"product ID.\" This is like looking up a word in a dictionary to find its definition.\n","Lists: You retrieve data by its position (index). Imagine a numbered queue; you ask for \"the item at position 3.\" Python has to count from the beginning to find it. This means it can be slower for large lists as it might need to check many items.\n","Dictionaries: You retrieve data by its label (key). Imagine a set of labeled drawers; you ask for \"the item in the 'Name' drawer.\" Python uses a clever trick (hashing) to directly go to that specific \"drawer.\" This makes retrieval extremely fast, typically taking the same amount of time no matter how many items are in the dictionary.*\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d04d1448-780b-4c3e-90a6-367214566ccc","metadata":{"id":"d04d1448-780b-4c3e-90a6-367214566ccc"},"source":["# Practical
